# Steel Observer

This is a simple as yet project aiming to facilitate the exchange of market information.

Registered users can upload data available to them and get access to information submitted by others.

The project has been developed with steel trade in mind (hence the title) but the same logic can be applied to any commodities or financial assets.


In a next stage, the functionality will be elaborated by adding more sophisticated statistical analysis tools.
